# docking-test-in-python
Dockig method is a popular method for drug design and drug dilivery. Currently our lab is tring to docking normal protein with sickle prion protein. The purpose for that is to find a energy stage which is lower and stable.

The docking part has been finished. Now I am working on the scoring part and hope I can upload that part as soon as possible.

These two pdb file is the modified protein and ligand.
